        Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages,
        can be compared to objects in real life. In JavaScript, an object 
        is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with
        a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has
        a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way,
        JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
